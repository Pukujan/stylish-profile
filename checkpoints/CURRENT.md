# Current Repository Checkpoint

<!-- continuity:current {"active_task":null,"active_task_file":null,"protocol_version":"0.1.0-draft","schema":"project-continuity.current.v1"} -->

This is an as-of projection; live GitHub issues own progression. Link the owning leaf, parent ancestry and dependencies for active work.

## Program state

Phase: bootstrap.

## Completed

- continuity protocol initialized.
- SP-0001: the profile page shipped, with the illustrations, charts, and the written record.
- SP-0002: the projects table, a spoken note per project, four-frame animations, and a derived dark variant of every image.
- SP-0003: every voice note opens and plays, the dark variants cannot go stale without failing the gate, and the account has an avatar drawn as the same character as the page.
- SP-0004: the dark illustrations keep the character's own colours, and both pages introduce Pujan instead of auditing him.
- SP-0005: every content-system record matches the page it describes, and the length printed beside each voice note is checked against the clip.

## Active

None. The work on the shipped page is finished; what is left is owner actions and one refresh that waits on them.

## Queued

- Re-run the tracker once the two probe repositories are gone, so the `sanitizer-probe` row leaves `profile/tracking.json`.
- Upload the avatar to the GitHub account, which is a web-UI action the REST API does not expose.
- Delete the two throwaway probe repositories, which needs the `delete_repo` scope on the `gh` token.

## Blockers

None known.

## Next atomic action

Nothing is in flight. The first item in Queued is the tracker refresh, and it
cannot start until the owner deletes the two probe repositories in the web UI.
